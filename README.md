App that can let a user pic a spot on the map and see Flickr images from that location. Part of Udacity coursework

## Common Usage

Users can: 

- Long press on a part of the map to put down a pin
- Tap on the pin to see images uploaded via Flickr associated with that geographic area
- Remove images from the collection view by tapping on the image and then pressing the delete button
- Get a new group of images.

The app uses CoreData to persist both the images and the pins, and the images are removed from the device when deleted.
